# Azure-Data-Engineering-Project
Azure Data Engineering project using Databricks, Data Lake, Delta Lake, Key Vault &amp; PySpark. Built secure Data Lake Storage &amp; Databricks workspace, ingested and transformed CSV data using PySpark, implemented SQL-based CRUD operations, time travel, ZORDER optimization, and real-time streaming with Auto Loader.

1)  Built and secured Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Databricks workspace; connected them using service
principal credentials and Azure Key Vault for secure access via dbutils.secrets.

2) Developed PySpark notebooks in Python to read and transform CSV data; saved results into external Delta Lake
tables and implemented SQL-based CRUD operations, time travel, data versioning, and ZORDER optimization.

3) Applied Auto Loader for incremental ingestion and used readStream/writeStream for real-time data processing;
leveraged Databricks utilities for secure file access, interactivity, and notebook-driven workflows.
